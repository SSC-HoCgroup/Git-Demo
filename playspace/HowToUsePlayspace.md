##Introduction to the Playspace Folder

Playspace is a folder designed for you to *safely* try out different Git commands, without causing any serious damage to anyone else's work. 

####How to Use Playspace

1. Create a new folder inside the Playspace folder, and name it the same name as your GitHub username.
2. Add your personal Playspace folder to the repository by using the "git add" command, like so:
  * ```git add playspace/my_github_username/```
3. Commit your changes before you begin experimenting with "git commit":
  * ```git commit -m "Created a playspace folder for my_github_username - MY INITIALS"```
4. Now go have fun!
