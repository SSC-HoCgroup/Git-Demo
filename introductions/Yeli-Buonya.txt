Short Bio: 
My name is Y’Eli(pronounced Lee), I know how weird! I just transferred from Tacoma Community college. I’m currently working on my transfer degree to UW Seattle. I intend on majoring in C.S and would like to specialize in computer security. I recall watching the movie “Hackers” at a very young age, and I was completely hooked. I am very passionate about the tech industry, and really enjoy observing the new trends and technologies that continue to shape our culture and society.

Coding/Tech interests:
Computer security, Web development, and Software development.

Message for the group: 
Hi everyone! I hope you’re all excited as I am to begin learning about all things tech. I look forward to working with each and everyone of you, and can’t wait to see what happens over the next few quarters.
