Chayse Summers

Bio: I'm a computer science major looking to transfer to UW. I love to garden and play music as well as video games. I've been vegan for going on five years now and I have a very stubborn English Bulldog named Beefy. I recently got engaged and am to be wed in June of 2016!

Coding/Tech Intrests: My coding/tech intrests include app/web development, software building, problem solving. I'm very interested in the environment and so anyway that I can connect to that through computer science is great!
